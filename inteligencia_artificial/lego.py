# This program is intended to provided a set of functions to move a lego mindstorm
# ev3 using the debian based distro ev3dev and was made for a Mexican school project
# at Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara

#
# The lego functions are implemented thinking on the lego as a tank vehicule with
# a gripper in the front and two sensors of his back
