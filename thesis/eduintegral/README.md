# Thesis

This repository is made with the intention to contain all the code used for my
thesis, also this thesis is created with the intention to be a means to obtain
my masters degree title from the Masters of Computer Science on the Universidad
Autonoma de Guadalajara.

## Goal

The goal of this project is creating a mobile app capable of help school
teachers do their most common tasks in a simple manner using just their mobile
phones.

The common tasks considered are:

- Assistance list
- Conduct reports
- Homework registry

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** This project is **deprecated**, I'm not longer pursuing
getting my masters degree with this project, the reason is because I'm really
bad at mobile development and could not meet with the delivery standards for
my thesis adviser.
