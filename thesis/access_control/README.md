# Thesis

This repository is made with the intention to contain all the code used for my
thesis, also this thesis is created with the intention to be a means to obtain
my masters degree title from the Masters of Computer Science on the Universidad
Autonoma de Guadalajara.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a web application for one customer of
the company relatibyte, I would receive all the help and guidance needed from
the CEO of the company Michel Gutierrez.

Since this is a project with a company not all the data/code/documentation will
be provided for making the thesis although is probably that a lot things can be
store in this repository.

The project is going to try to apply all the things learned from the masters
so is going to have many topics integrated into it.

This topics are from my classes:

- Analysis and Algorithm Design
- Microcomputers Architecture
- Advanced Network Protocols
- Software Quality Assurance
- Advanced Databases
- Advanced Operating Systems
- Software Architecture and Design
- Distributed and Concurrent Systems
- Statistic and Probability for Scientists and Engineers
- Software projects administration
- Artificial Intelligence
- Image processing

The project is about providing access control of a condominium to manage the
entrance through a web application.
